# Multi-Agent-Training
A repo for my research in multi-agent training machine learning algorithms

1. The MATD3 training didn't really work. I'm not sure why. I tested a lot of different variables, but nothing yeilded a good result. I'm going to test multi-agent DQN next because I think that'll be more promising.
